11. Questions & Ideas
=====================
For future planning and open items.


Resolved (ERD V4) //TODO: Remenmber to keep UPDATED!
-----------------
[x] Multi-language support: How does it affect project architecture?
    → Resolved: Simple VARCHAR for MVP. JSON columns deferred to future version.
    → See architecture.txt for details.

[x] Translation fields for admin-created content
    → Resolved: MVP uses single-language VARCHAR columns.
    → Future: JSON columns with EN/ET/RU translations.

[x] User/Admin entity structure
    → Resolved: Single `user` table with role ENUM (ADMIN, CLIENT).
    → MVP uses ADMIN role only. CLIENT role for future customer accounts.

[x] Delivery option: optional vs required?
    → Resolved: delivery_type_id is NOT NULL (required).
    → "I bring it myself" is a delivery_type option with price=0.

[x] Package selection: junction table vs direct FK?
    → Resolved: Direct FK (booking.package_id) - exactly 1 package per booking.
    → Enforced at database level.

[x] Pricing model
    → Resolved: Pure additive formula.
    → total_price = vehicle_type.base_price + package.price + SUM(add_on.price) + delivery_type.price

[ ] Should be added "policy" page as well. CRITICAL for car_number storage!
[ ] Where is address information gathered? Is it wrtitten in "client.txt"?


Future Enhancements (Not MVP)
-----------------------------
- Payment integration
- Client accounts / login (uses existing user table with CLIENT role)
- Mobile native applications
- SMS notifications
- Booking confirmation link (before instant cancel)
- Admin email alerts for new bookings
- Booking reminders (24h before)
- Multi-language content (JSON columns for translatable entities)
- JWT authentication (currently session-based)
